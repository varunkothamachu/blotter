Over the summer I will be participating in the Summer Undergraduate Research Program at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. I will be learning from, and assisting the Bedford Lab with research investigating what degree protein stability affects influenza evolution. I am currently finishing my junior year at the University of Washington, studying both Microbiology and Applied and Computational Math Sciences.
