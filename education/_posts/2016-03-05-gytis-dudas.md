I'm a [Mahan Postdoctoral Fellow](http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/phs/projects/herbold-computational-biology-program.html) at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](http://www.fhcrc.org/) and I study RNA viruses over time. Imprints of evolutionary forces on viral genomes can be investigated in great detail when sequence data, population genetics theory and phylogenetics are used in combination, offering a glimpse into the dynamics of their hosts, ecology and conflicts.

I received my undergraduate degree in evolutionary biology at the University of Edinburgh, where I did my PhD as well. Under [Andrew Rambaut](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/people/arambaut/)'s supervision I primarily focused on exploiting non-clonal evolution of RNA viruses and using viral genomes to investigate aspects of their ecology virtually inaccesible via any other means. I have also been heavily involved with research into the 2013-2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, mostly working on temporal and spatial phylogenetics of the virus behind the epidemic as well as data curation.
