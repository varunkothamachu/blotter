In the fall I will be starting my PhD in Epidemiology at the University of Washington. I’m interested in how we can use pathogen sequence data to understand patterns in disease transmission, and from an applied public health perspective, how we use that data to better prepare for and respond to outbreaks.

I received my bachelor’s from Quest University in British Columbia, Canada, studying health sciences, and did a post-baccalaureate year at the University of Manitoba studying microbiology. I’m currently finishing my master’s in Genetic Epidemiology at the University of Washington, investigating evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus, a rhabdovirus that infects Pacific salmon.
