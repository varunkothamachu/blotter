I am a new Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Trevor Bedford's group at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. I study the mathematical modeling of epidemic wavelike dynamics and virus phylogenetic inference. My initial project will focus on the influenza virus. My solid background in theoretical and experimental physics is desired to study complex biological systems in a quantitative way.

I received my PhD from University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, advised by William Harter. Following my PhD, I worked on biophysical diffusion modeling with the Basic Sciences Division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
