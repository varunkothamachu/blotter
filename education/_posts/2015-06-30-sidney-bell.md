I am a graduate student at the University of Washington, where I am pursuing a joint MS in Epidemiology (advised by Trevor Bedford) and a PhD in Molecular and Cell Biology (advised by Michael Emerman). Generally, I am interested in questions about how viruses evolve and interact with their hosts. What allows a virus to infect a new host species? How do viruses then adapt to their new hosts? How does this play out over evolutionary time?
