Welcome.  I created this site to host my work, both large and small.  Large research have a natural home as articles  in scientific journals.  However, I'll often spend an afternoon following up on some small thing that's of passing interest to me.  I would like to keep a journal of these small creations.  Not planning a blog, but something involving a bit more novelty.  We'll see what happens...
